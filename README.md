**My current idea of the game is a console 'adventure rpg' somewhat along the lines of a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game:**
- The gameplay will be multiple non-linear 'landscapes' based on rng factors.
- Player-level based items (potentially based on a multiplier so dmg, crit, and special ability will scale (log function?) with player level)
- Inventory system ('bag' as well as basic armour/weapon slots)
- Shop and balance system
- save/load to/from JSON
- Difficulty levels (change scaling with weapons/armour/player levels/enemy levels/rng factors)
- Enemy level and rng factors will scale with player level as well

*Potentially:*
- Using terminal colour/cleaning (or a more graphical console emulation with a gui)
- I'm not too keen on the idea but possibly a story
